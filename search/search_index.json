Chris agreed with this.</p> <p>We then eliminated the ACT program at MIT's website as there was too much accessability work to be done, though it was a very interesting visual concept.</p> <p>Suzanne Collin's site was a strong contender as it had a clear purpose and brand. It needed better page structure and call-to-action buttons.

A web app should solve a specific problem effectively for a user to find it useful.</p> <p>Usable You can't use something that doesn't work. If your navigation is broken, you're missing assets, or the site won't load, people won't use it.</p> <p>Findable If a user can't find your product, none of these other factors will matter. Good SEO and use of semantic tags is vital for helping users find your product in the vast ocean of the web.</p> <p>Credible Anybody can create a site, so it's important that your site looks credible in order for users to trust it. Poor design can easily influence a user's decision to trust your site or not.  </p> <p>Desirable Aesthetics and trends play a large part in what products users decide to use. It's so powerful that sometimes a product doesn't need to be useful or useable for it to be desired.</p> <p>Accessible Users might not use your product simply because they can't. Any amount of disabilities, from vision, movement, or cognitive function might prevent a user from being able to use a product well.</p> <p>Valuable Lastly, your product must add value to the user's life in some way.

The hover states are unprofessional.</p> <p></p> <p>Shop/Catalogue The cart should have a standalone menu button to be accessible from all pages, not hidden at the bottom of the menu. The cart page itself has a thoughtless layout, negatively impacting it's visual appeal.</p> <p> To access the catalogue the user must choose from a series of options in the main menu, rather than allowing them to sort the results on a main catalogue page.
