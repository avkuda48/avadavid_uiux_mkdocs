# Tools for UI/UX Projects

This page explains a 5 step methodology to user-focused UI/UX design and 7 usability factors, which help outline how to redesign a specific website.

## Five Step Method

The goal of this method is to outline the current issues and fix them. It is **user focused**, meaning that we design with the user's experience at the forefront of our minds.

**Empathize**  
Consider issues that the user might encounter while using your product. How well can the user accomplish their goals?  

**Define**  
 Define your issues more concretely. What is the exact problem the user is facing? What is causing that problem? What factors are involved?

**Ideate**  
Start brainstorming solutions. How can we help the user accomplish their goals in the fastest and most effective way possible?

**Prototype**  
Take the best solutions and implement them on a small scale. How will they fit into the current design?

**Test**  
Test your prototype and get feedback on your design. Fix new issues that arise and refine your solutions to better meet the needs of your users.

## Seven Usability Factors

The seven usability factors help us consider possible **barriers** to our application.

**Useful**  
If the application is not useful, nobody wants to use it! A web app should solve a **specific** problem effectively for a user to find it useful.

**Usable**  
You can't use something that doesn't work. If your navigation is broken, you're missing assets, or the site won't load, people won't use it.

**Findable**  
If a user can't find your product, none of these other factors will matter. Good SEO and use of semantic tags is vital for helping users find your product in the vast ocean of the web.

**Credible**  
Anybody can create a site, so it's important that your site looks credible in order for users to trust it. Poor design can easily influence a user's decision to trust your site or not.  

**Desirable**  
Aesthetics and trends play a large part in what products users decide to use. It's so powerful that sometimes a product doesn't need to be useful or useable for it to be desired.

**Accessible**  
Users might not use your product simply because they can't. Any amount of disabilities, from vision, movement, or cognitive function might prevent a user from being able to use a product well.

**Valuable**  
Lastly, your product must add value to the user's life in some way. Otherwise, what's stopping them from using a similar product or service?
