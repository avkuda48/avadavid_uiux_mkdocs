# Problem Statement

A problem statement narrows down the specific issues a product has. Anna and I created a problem statement involving the issues we outlined in past weeks.

## Toronto Cupcake Problem Statement

*Toronto Cupcake’s website makes it difficult for users to achieve their goals of ordering cupcakes and catering effectively.*

*The lack of structure, dated branding, and unintuitive navigation makes it un appealing and frustrating to use. This inclines customers to opt for a different bakery.*

*The website should be redesigned as soon as possible to effectively appeal to its intended audience.*

*The focus of the redesign should be on corporate-specific catering, a niche that makes the business stand out among competitors.*

This needs little explanation as these core structure and design flaws are ones we have been harping on since week one.
