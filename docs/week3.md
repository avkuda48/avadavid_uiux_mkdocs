# User Personas, Stories, and Scenarios - Week 3

This week, we spent some more time defining who are users are and the problems they may face when using our website. We created two **user personas**, three **stories** for each of them, and three **scenarios** between the two.

## User Personas

Creating a fictional user for your application is helpful for determining how the app should be made and what you should focus on as a dev. Anna and I created one user persona each to represent the two main clients Toronto Cupcake would have: corporations and event planners.

>*Meet Cheryl, the assistant ED at RBCs Toronto HQ. She considers herself the ‘fun boss’ and regularly organizes company parties, team working events, birthdays, and more on top of her duties as assistant ED. She cares deeply about a healthy and enjoyable work environment and about giving back to her community.*

Giving a user persona a photo, background, and personality helps make them feel more real and easier to empathize with. From this bio, I can start to see the things that a user like Cheryl would need out of our website and what would make her experience better.

For example, as an assistant ED, Cheryl would be very busy and need the ordering and delivery systems to be quick and painless, from finding the cupcakes she wants to order, placing it, to pick up. She needs to adhere to company budget and expectations, so the cupcakes should be reasonably priced and to a professional standard.

If I understand a sample user's needs, wants, goals, and paint points, I can build my web app to solve them efficiently.

## User Story

User stories follow a specific formula:

*As a ______ , I want to _____ so that I can _______ .*

This helps a developer outline what a user might want to do and why, allowing them to come up with the how. Here are Cheryl's three user stories:

### One

>As an assistant ED, I want to know the specific time and place my cupcake order will be delivered so that I can plan accordingly.

This tells me as a developer that I need a page to show the user the date, time, and location of their cupcake delivery.

### Two

>As an active member of my community, I want to choose to support a local business so that I can feel good about who I am supporting.

This tells me that I need to better showcase Toronto Cupcake's connection with their community, because they are certainly avid members of it!

### Three

>As an assistant ED, I want to quickly see what cupcakes are available and order them so that I can carry on with the rest of my work tasks.

This means I need to better structure the cupcake catalogue so that it is more accessible and easy to understand. I also need to streamline the ordering process so it makes clear and total sense.

## User Scenarios

Finally, user scenarios help a developer to begin to mock up the page structure and flow of the website. You take your user story and create a high-level file path that will solve the user's story.

For example:
>As an active member of my community, I want to choose to support a local business so that I can feel good about who I am supporting.

1. Start at the home page
2. Navigate to the menu
3. Select the 'giving back' option
4. Read the page on how Toronto Cupcake gives back to its community.

The pieces of how our site will look and behave are slowly coming into place thanks to these three tools.
