# User Personas, Stories, and Scenarios

This week, we created two **user personas**, three **stories** for each of them, and three **scenarios** between the two. These help us identify the functionality our site needs to have in order for a user to achieve their goals successfully.

## User Personas

Creating a fictional user for your application is helpful for determining what you should focus on as a dev. Anna and I created one user persona each to represent the two main clients Toronto Cupcake would have: corporations and event planners.

>*Meet Cheryl, the assistant ED at RBCs Toronto HQ. She considers herself the ‘fun boss’ and regularly organizes company parties, team working events, and birthdays on top of her duties as assistant ED. She cares deeply about a healthy work environment and about giving back to her community.*

Giving a user persona a face, background, and personality helps make them feel more real and easier to empathize with. If I understand a sample user's needs, wants, goals, and pain points, I can build my web app around that.

## User Story

User stories follow a specific formula:

**As a (user type), I want to (feature) so that I can (user goal).**

This helps a developer outline what a specific user might want to do with their application and why, allowing them to come up with the how. Here are Cheryl's three user stories:

### One

>"As an assistant ED, I want to know the specific time and place my cupcake order will be delivered so that I can plan accordingly."

This tells me that I need a page to show the user the date, time, and location of their cupcake delivery.

### Two

>"As an active member of my community, I want to buy from a local business so that I can feel good about who I am supporting."

This tells me that I need to better showcase Toronto Cupcake's connection with their community, because they are certainly avid members of it!

### Three

>"As an assistant ED, I want to quickly see what cupcakes are available and order them so that I can carry on with the rest of my work tasks."

This means I need to better structure the catalogue so that it is more accessible and easy to understand. I also need to streamline the ordering process so it makes clear and total sense.

## User Scenarios

Finally, user scenarios help a developer to begin to mock up the page structure and flow of the website. Take your user story and create a high-level file path that describes how the user will go about completing their goal.  
For example, this story:

>"As an active member of my community, I want to choose to support a local business so that I can feel good about who I am supporting."

Has this scenario:

1. Cheryl starts at the home page
2. Navigates to the menu
3. Selects the 'giving back' option
4. Reads the page on how Toronto Cupcake gives back to its community.

The pieces of how our site will look and behave are slowly coming into place thanks to these three tools.
