# Week 4 - Scope and Problem Statements

We continue to define the issues with Toronto Cupcake using **Problem Statements** and outline the **scope** of what we can accomplish.

## Problem Statement

A problem statement narrows down the specific issues a product has. Anna and I created a problem statement involving the issues we outlined in past weeks:

>The issue with Toronto Cupcake’s website is that the website does not succeed at appealing
to its main audience and customers: corporate and casual event planners.  
The poor website
structure and design, dated branding, and unintuitive navigation make it difficult to use the website, which may incline customers to opt for a different bakery with a more
professional-looking website.  
The website should be redesigned as soon as possible to start effectively appealing to its intended audiences. The focus on the redesign should be for its corporate customers, because their corporate-specific catering is a niche that could help the business stand out among competitors.

I think this needs little explanation as these core structure and design flaws are ones we have been harping on since week one.
