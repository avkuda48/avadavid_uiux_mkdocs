# Website to Redesign - Week 1

## The Task

We were tasked with choosing a website to redesign. We needed to find a website that required enough work to utilize the skills we were taught in Design 1 and the skills we will learn in our UI/UX course.  

My personal goals for this assignment are:  

1. Create a satisfying user experience

2. Design an appealing and applicable brand

## How I Did It

We found five websites that we knew had UX issues or that could use a redesign. Those Five websites were:

1. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)
2. [Toronto Cupcakes](https://www.torontocupcake.com/)
3. [Suzanne Collins](https://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/)
4. [BCIT Student Self Service](https://bss.bcit.ca/owa_prod/twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name=bmenu.P_MainMnu)
5. [ACT at MIT](https://act.mit.edu/about/)

### Eliminated Sites and Why

We eliminated Stack Overflow and BCIT Student Self Service because they were simply too big. They are both web apps that have many functions and would be extremely time consuming to redesign. Chris agreed with this conclusion.

We eliminated the ACT program at MIT's website as there was too much accessability work to be done. We thought we could do a lot with all the poorly implemented animations, hover states, and low-contrast colours. Though it was a very interesting concept that could be improved, we ultimately went another route.

Suzanne Collin's site was a strong contender as it has a clear purpose and brand. It needed work directing the user's eye and some call-to-action buttons. We decided not to go with this site as we felt there was not as much to do.

## Website Chosen for Redesign

We chose Toronto Cupcake as our site to redesign. It is a cupcake bakery based in Toronto with a focus on selling whimsical cupcakes to their customers, as well as offering catering services to corporate businesses.

## Why This Website was Chosen

We will be redesigning Toronto Cupcakes because it is a great combination of these opportunities.

 The user experience is very frustrating and has much room for improvement, specifically in the ordering and delivering of products. The ordering page is not accessible from the menu, but rather from a button on a random page.

The navigation is not to standard at all, and the page structure is very messy. Many options are hidden on certain pages. The navigation should not be vertical with dropdown options. Options like 'order now' should not be hidden in specific pages. Overall, the navigation site-wide lacks clarity, and fixing this will improve the user's experience.

The brand does not align very well with the goals of the business, so we will rebrand it entirely. It should appeal more to the corporate audience as well as the general public. Being a bakery, I think there will be a lot of fun in designing a better brand for this company. As it is, it does not appeal to their corporate audience and looks quite basic and dated in the eyes of their customers.

Overall, I think this company has a very interesting niche which provides us the opportunity to have some fun and make something exciting!

## Why Work in a Team

I will rarely be working solo on projects. Working as a team for this assignment will help me better understand common problems I may encounter working as a team and helps me figure them out in a safe environment.

It also helps reduce the workload, as this is a large assignment and we have many classes this semester.

## Hope for these Classes

One of my goals for this class is to have some real experience working on a coding project with another dev.  
I also want to better connect my soft business skills with my hard coding skills so I can get a better understanding of what work in this profession will look like.
