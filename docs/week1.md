# Website to Redesign - Week 1

## The Task

Our task was to choose a bad website to redesign. The website required enough work to utilize the skills we were taught in Design 1 and the skills we will learn in our UI/UX course.  

My personal goals for this assignment are:  

1. Create a satisfying user experience

2. Design an appealing and applicable brand

## How I Did It

We found five websites that we knew had UX issues or that could use a redesign. Those Five websites were:

1. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)
2. [Toronto Cupcakes](https://www.torontocupcake.com/)
3. [Suzanne Collins](https://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/)
4. [BCIT Student Self Service](https://bss.bcit.ca/owa_prod/twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name=bmenu.P_MainMnu)
5. [ACT at MIT](https://act.mit.edu/about/)

### Eliminated Sites and Why

We eliminated Stack Overflow and BCIT Student Self Service because they simply had too much functionality and pages. Chris agreed with this conclusion.

We eliminated the ACT program at MIT's website as there was too much accessability work to be done. Though it was a very interesting concept that could be improved, we ultimately went another route.

Suzanne Collin's site was a strong contender as it has a clear purpose and brand. It needed better page structure and call-to-action buttons. We decided not to go with this site as we felt there was not as much to do.

## Website Chosen for Redesign

Our chosen website is [Toronto Cupcake](https://www.torontocupcake.com/). It is a cupcake bakery based in Toronto with a focus on selling whimsical cupcakes to their customers, as well as offering catering services to corporate businesses and for events.

## Why This Website was Chosen

This website is a great combination of the opportunities the other five websites had.

 The user experience is very frustrating and has much room for improvement, specifically in the ordering and delivering of products. The ordering page is not accessible from the menu, but rather from a button on a random page.

The navigation is not to standard at all, and the page structure is very messy. Many options are hidden on certain pages. The navigation should not be vertical with dropdown options. Options like 'order now' should not be hidden in specific pages. Overall, the navigation site-wide lacks clarity, and fixing this will improve the user's experience.

The brand does not align well with the goals of the business, so we will rebrand it entirely. As it is, it lack professionalism to their corporate audience and looks dated in the eyes of their customers.

Overall, I think this company has a very interesting niche which provides us the opportunity to make something exciting!

## Why Work in a Team

Working with Anna for this assignment will help me better understand common problems I may encounter when working as a team and will help me figure them out in a safe environment. It's important to work these kinks out now, as I will rarely be working solo.

It also helps reduce the workload, as this is a large assignment and we have many classes this semester.

## Hope for these Classes

One of my goals for this class is to have some real experience working on a coding project with another dev.  
I also want to better connect my design skills with my coding skills so I can get a better understanding of what what my skill set is capable of.
